Starter for small app (back/front end) for running script

This is a small starter for running simple scripts on a raspberry pi. The goal is of course to install Raspbian and configure an apache for exposing the service.

The backend could be able to send email based on the result of the script but that's not the point here ;-)

Backend

For running backend, please clone "back" folder into your www/ folder. Then, be sure you have every needed php module installed.

You need:
â€¢ PHP >= 7.1.3

sudo apt install php


â€¢ OpenSSL PHP Extension (Included on Linux by default)
â€¢ PDO PHP Extension (MySQL, MariaDB)

sudo apt install php-mysql


â€¢ Mbstring PHP Extension

sudo apt install php-mbstring


During my install, I also installed those but I'm not sure they are needed...

php-ext-dom AND/OR php-xml


Summary

To install everything needed in point of vue of the backend, please run the following command

apt install composer php php-mysql php-mbstring php-xml mysql


Installation

It's time to install php dependencies thanks to Composer via the following command

composer install


Then copy .env.example file in .env and edit informations for your config.

Of course, in your apache configuration you will expose only the public folder of the back folder.

Front-End

Based on Angular + Angular Material , the front-end is really easy to use and implement. For this, we play also with Angular CLI . You can install it by running this:

npm install -g @angular/cli


Thanks to this, you can generate easily some components, services, etc.

For running the front-end via Apache, you should follow those steps:
1. run npm install into your frontend project
2. run ng build --aot for building the project
3. Copy the content of dist folder into your Apache.

Install of npm

If you don't have yet npm and nodejs installed on your linux, please install nvm . Please run the following commands :

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash


nvm install 8


nvm use 8


VoilÃ ! Npm is now available on your linux ðŸ˜ƒ
